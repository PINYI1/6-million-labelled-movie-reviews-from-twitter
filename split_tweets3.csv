"#DetectivePikachu was such a great experience. I grew up obsessed with Pokemon as a kid, so obviously there was a lot of nostalgia, but on top of that, it's just a really good movie.   If it's something you're vaguely interested in, take a chance, because I loved it.","Pokemon Detective Pikachu"
"Pokemon: Detective Pikachu (½) - Its the kind of movie that you expect to be the 5th or 6th of its franchise when they've run completely out of ideas.  They had a guaranteed free shot, but they blew it on a truly bizarre gimmick.","Pokemon Detective Pikachu"
